SaasKit
=======

Welcome to the **SaasKit** project. Are you wondering what saas mean? It's a shortcut of Software as a Service.

#### Requirements

- Xcode 6.0 and iOS 8.0 SDK
- CocoaPods 0.35 rc2 (use `sudo gem install cocoapods` to grab it!)

#### Configuration
- `git clone git@github.com:netguru/saaskit.git`
- `pod install`

#### Coding guidelines
- Please respect Ray Wenderlich's Objective-C [style guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/objective-c-style-guide).
- The code should be readable and self-explanatory - full variable names, meaningful methods, etc.
- Write documentation **only** when needed (eg. hacks, tricky parts). Exception: This doesn't apply to .h comments used to documentation.
- Please leave no commented-out code.
- Always **commit to master**. No remote branches, forks and pull requests.

#### Code Review
Please do regular code review. More information can be found in [this wiki article](https://wiki.netguru.co/Tech-guides/Netguru%20guides%20setup%20and%20info/code-review). Visit the review application to begin reviewing.
